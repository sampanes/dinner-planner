Wash and dry produce. • Trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; slice crosswise into 1⁄2-inch-thick half-moons. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion.\n\nRoast Zucchini\n2\n• Toss zucchini on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, half the Italian Seasoning (you’ll use the rest later), and a pinch of salt and pepper. • Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until browned and tender, 14-16 minutes. • Tent with foil to keep warm.\n\nCook Pasta\n3\n• Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. • Reserve 11⁄2 cups pasta cooking water (2 cups for 4 servings), then drain.\n\nCook Onion & Sausage\n4\n• While pasta cooks, remove sausage* from casing if necessary; discard casing. • Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5-6 minutes. • Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 3-4 minutes (it’ll finish cooking in the next step).\n\nMake Sauce\n5\n• Add tomato paste and remaining Italian Seasoning to pan. Cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 1 minute. • Stir in stock concentrate, 1 cup reserved pasta cooking water (11⁄2 cups for 4 servings), and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer; cook until sauce has slightly thickened and sausage is cooked through, 2-3 minutes. • Reduce heat to medium low.\n\nFinish & Serve\n6\n• Stir drained cavatappi, roasted zucchini, sour cream, and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) into pan until thoroughly combined. TIP: If needed, stir in more reserved cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce. • Divide pasta between bowls. Sprinkle with Parmesan and serve.\n\nPork Sausage is fully cooked when internal temperature reaches 160°.",
